# Automated Reasoning Repair Dataset

## Java+JML

This dataset has 30 correct programs with full JML specifications such that OpenJML's ESC can verify each program's correctness. We consider these 30 programs to be correct initial programs (for ARR and for deriving the buggy versions described below).


## BuggySpecification

BuggySpecification is a dataset of 53 updated programs based on the Java+JML Dataset.  OpenJML's ESC cannot verify these, but they are correct.  These 53 programs are divided into two different classes.

1.  NotVerifiedPrograms: These 30 programs were changed manually. These changes did not change the character of the initial programs. However, they changed the return type of the programs, method and fields visibilities, or the names of local variables or fields.

2. NotVerified_APR: These 23 programs are generated by seven Automated Program Repair (APR) tools while fixing buggy programs in the [BuggyJava+JML](https://github.com/Amirfarhad-Nilizadeh/BuggyJavaJML) dataset. APR tools correctly repair these programs; however, OpenJML's ESC cannot verify these repaired programs by using the specifications in the Java+JML dataset.
