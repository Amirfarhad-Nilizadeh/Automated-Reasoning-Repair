# Automated Reasoning Repair Dataset

## Java+JML

This dataset has 30 correct programs with full JML specifications that OpenJML's ESC can verify the correctness of these programs. We considered these 30 programs as correct initial programs.


## BuggySpecification

BuggySpecification is a dataset of 53 updated programs based on the Java+JML Dataset that OpenJML's ESC cannot verify, but they are correct.  These 53 programs are divided into two different classes.

1.  NotVerifiedPrograms: These 30 programs are updated manually. They did not change the character of the initial programs. They changed the return type of the programs, or methods and fields visibility, or changed the name of local or fields variables.

2. NotVerified_APR: These 23 programs are generated by seven Automated Program Repair (APR) tools while fixing buggy programs in the [BuggyJava+JML](https://github.com/Amirfarhad-Nilizadeh/BuggyJavaJML) dataset. APR tools correctly repair these programs; however, OpenJML's ESC cannot verify them by using the specification of the Java+JML dataset.
